## A website for developers where teammates can collaborate in secure rooms to share code snippets.
# Key Features of the Website:
	1. Secure Collaborative Rooms: Each room is protected by a unique room code. Any teammate with the code can join and participate in code sharing (paste or copy).
	
	2. Multiple Pages per Room: A single room can have multiple pages. Each page is independent, so teammates can work on different code without interfering with each other.
	
	3. Page-Specific Language Selection: Each page allows you to set a preferred programming language, enabling coding in different languages within the same room.
	
	4. Dedicated Coding Environment: Every language comes with its own coding environment for a smooth experience.
	
	5. AI Assistants: I’ve integrated three types of AI assistants that can help detect errors, fix errors, explain code, and even suggest optimizations.
(Not going to lie… it feels almost like using VS Code and GitHub together 😎)
