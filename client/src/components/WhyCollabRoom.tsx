          Why We Built CollabRoom
        </h2>

          Sharing code shouldn’t require spinning up an IDE, setting up a repo,
          or pasting screenshots. CollabRoom was created to make quick, secure,
          and real collaboration effortless—so you can focus on your ideas,
          not on setup.
